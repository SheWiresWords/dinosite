    <p class = "intro">Hi! My name is Dino and this is my website. The name Dino is my alias for this website! My site has two pages: a home and a portfolio. You're on my home page right now. Here, I'm introducing myself. On my portfolio page, you can find images and descriptions of the things I like to do. Have fun! </p>

    <p class = "intro"> Ever since I was little, I loved trying new things. Now, I have a bunch of hobbies that I really like. I love indoor and outdoor activities, including sports, cooking, reading, art, and music. Out of all these things, I don't have a favorite, but what makes all my pastimes truly fun is my friends! If you click on the portfolio link above, you will see how I spend time with them :)</p>
